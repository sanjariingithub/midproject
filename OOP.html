    <h3>Java - What is OOP?</h3>
    <h5>OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.</h5>
    <p>Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>OOP is faster and easier to execute</li>
    <li>OOP provides a clear structure for the programs</li>
    <li>OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug</li>
    <li>OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time</li>      
  </ul>
